'''
You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. 
The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.
Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.
Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. 
For this to work, you must enter all the names as name followed by comma then space.
'''

# Split string method
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")
names = names_string.split(", ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

import random

list_size = len(names) - 1
random_name = names[random.randint(0, list_size)]

print(f"{random_name} is going to buy the meal today.")

'''
**You can shorten the code using choice() method above:**

import random

random_name = random.choice(names)
print(f"{random_name} is going to buy the meal today.")
