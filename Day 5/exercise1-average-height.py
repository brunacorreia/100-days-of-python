'''
You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

Example of output expected:
There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights
Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

**Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. 
You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.**
