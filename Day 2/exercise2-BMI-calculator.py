Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person
and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m)

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
bodymass_index = round(weight / height**2)
print(f"Your Body Mass Index is {bodymass_index}")
